#BungeeCompass
===============

Original Project: https://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/bungeecompass/

This is a slightly modified version of bungeecompass.
The modifications mean the compass will only be given to the player in a world defined in the config.
It is recommended that a "per world inventory" plugin is also used.
Also adds a listener to stop the player moving the compass.
